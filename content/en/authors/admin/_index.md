## Biografia 
Currently, I am conducting research (PIBIC) in the field of geocoding in the Federal District. I am a teaching assistant for the cartography course and participate in the LAGAS laboratory at the University of Bras√≠lia. I have experience in the Geosciences area with a focus on geoprocessing.
